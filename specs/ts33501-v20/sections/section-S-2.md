# S.2	General

5G NSWO shall use EAP-AKA’, as specified in RFC 5448 [12], for authentication. The EAP-AKA’ implementations shall comply with the EAP-AKA’ profile specified in Annex F of the present document.
A new network function, called NSWOF, is introduced to support authentication for NSWO in 5GS. The NSWOF interfaces to the WLAN access network using SWa interface and interfaces to the AUSF using Service Based Interface (SBI).
