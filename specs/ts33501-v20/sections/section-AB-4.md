# AB.4	Policy Check

To control the information exchange between the PNI-NPN operational domain and the PLMN operational domain, policy checks can be performed by the proxy entity at the border that segregates the trust domain between these operational domains.
Policy check can be defined based on available controls from the present specification considering architectural requirements. Examples of such policy checks are:
1)	Having transport layer protection based on clause 13.1 of the present document.
2)	Having authorization based on clause 13.4 of the present document.
The selection and definition of the policies from the examples above or from the present specification is left to the choice of implementation considering the architectural needs.
