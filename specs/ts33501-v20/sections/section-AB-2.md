# AB.2	Architecture

Figure AB.2-1 Example of dedicated NFs deployed in the PNI-NPN operational domain
As depicted in Figure AB.2-1, dedicated UPF and part of CP functions are deployed in the PNI-NPN operational domain. The interface between the dedicated NFs in the PNI-NPN operational domain and the NFs in the PLMN operational domain is SBA interface.
NOTE: The choice of which of these CP functions (i.e., AMF or SMF, or both or none) are deployed in the PNI-NPN operational domain is a matter for deployment. Whether additional CP functions are deployed in the PNI-NPN operational domain and its associated additional security controls are  not considered in the present document.
When the AMF is deployed in the PNI-NPN operational domain, there exists a privacy risk regarding SUPI exposure outside the PLMN operational domain. Appropriate measures to mitigate this risk may be considered when choosing this architecture for deployment.
