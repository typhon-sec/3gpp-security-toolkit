# B.1	Introduction

The present annex describes an example of the usage of additional EAP methods for primary authentication in private networks using the 5G system as specified in TS 22.261  [7]. It is provided as an example on how the 5G authentication framework for primary authentication can be applied to EAP methods other than  EAP-AKA' The additional EAP methods are only intended for private networks or with IoT devices in isolated deployment scenarios, i.e. roaming is not considered, as specified in TS 22.261 [7].
When the 5G system is deployed in private networks, the SUPI and SUCI should be encoded using the NAI format as specified in TS 23.501 [2]. UE always includes the realm part in the NAI for routing to the correct UDM.
