The HPLMN may have a roaming agreement with a VPLMN for NSWO roaming. A roaming UE configured by the HPLMN to use 5G NSWO may try to register onto a WLAN AN that may advertise the HPLMN or a VPLMN (with which the HPLMN has a roaming agreement for NSWO roaming). The roaming architecture options are described in clause 4.2.15 in TS 23.501 [2].
