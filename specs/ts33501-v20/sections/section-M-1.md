# M.1	General

This Annex provides the security procedures applied to NR IAB architecture and functional entities for supporting wireless backhauling of NR base stations.
The overall stage 2 description for IAB architecture and functional entities are described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 38.401 [78].
The security requirements and security procedures applied to IAB in EN-DC architecture are defined in both TS 33.401 [10] and in the present document. The security requirements and security procedures between the IAB-node and the MeNB (i.e., when the IAB-node connects via E-UTRA to a MeNB), are defined in TS 33.401 [10] and between the IAB-node and the SgNB (F1 interface) are defined in this clause.
