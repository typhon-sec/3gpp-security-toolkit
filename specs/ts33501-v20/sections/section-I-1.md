# I.1	General

This Annex provides details on security for non-public networks. Most of the security procedures are the same as public networks so this annex only summarizes and specifies where there are exceptions to the normal procedures.
The feature for support of non-public networks (NPN) by 5GS is described in clause 5.30 of 23.501 [2].
NOTE 1:	The architecture of a PLMN hosting a NPN with dedicated NFs in the PNI-NPN operational domain is described in Annex AB.
