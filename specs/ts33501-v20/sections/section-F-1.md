# F.1	Introduction

The present annex describes the 3GPP 5G profile for EAP-AKA' described in RFC 5448 [12], and RFC 4187 [21].
NOTE: 	RFC 5448 [12] was specified for the needs of LTE and it does not take into account nor refer to 5G specifications. EAP-AKA’ identity handling, when it comes to 5G, is specified in the present Annex F. RFC 5448 [12] has been updated in RFC 9048  [67] to align with the 5G specifications and especially with Annex F. Otherwise RFC 9048  [67] is technically backwards compatible with RFC 5448 [12] . The present document uses RFC 5448 [12] as the normative reference and in case of technical discrepancy, RFC 5448 [12] and the present document take precedence over RFC 9048  [67].
