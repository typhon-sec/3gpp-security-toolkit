# AB.5	Security for DNS messages crossing the border

DNS messages crossing the trust boundary can be protected. Security configuration and profiling of DNS servers is left to implementation. The dedicated NFs in the PNI-NPN operational domain are provisioned with the DNS security configuration, for example using one of the following methods:
-	Pre-configuring the DNS security configuration in the dedicated NF.
-	Updating the DNS security configuration in the dedicated NF during NF instantiation via the OAM.
