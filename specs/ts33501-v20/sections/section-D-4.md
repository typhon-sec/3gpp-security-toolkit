# D.4	Test Data for the security algorithms


### D.4.1	General

Annex D.4 contains references to the test data for each of the specified algorithms.

### D.4.2	128-NEA1

For 128-NEA1 is the test data for UEA2 in TS 35.217 [36] can be reused directly as there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between UEA2 inputs and 128-NEA1 inputs.

### D.4.3	128-NIA1

For 128-NIA1 is the test data for 128-EIA1 in clause C.4 of TS 33.401 [10] can be reused directly as there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between 128-EIA1 inputs and 128-NIA1 inputs.

### D.4.4	128-NEA2

For 128-NEA2 is the test data for 128-EEA2 in clause C.1 of TS 33.401 [10] can be reused directly as there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between 128-EEA2 inputs and 128-NEA2 inputs.

### D.4.5	128-NIA2

For 128-NIA2 is the test data for 128-EIA2 in clause C.2 of TS 33.401 [10] can be reused directly as there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between 128-EIA2 inputs and 128-NIA2 inputs.

### D.4.6	128-NEA3

For 128-NEA3 is the test data for 128-EEA3 in TS 35.223 [37] can be reused directly as there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between 128-EEA3 inputs and 128-NEA3 inputs.

### D.4.7	128-NIA3

For 128-NIA3 is the test data for 128-EIA3 in TS 35.223 [37] can be reused directly as there is an exact, one-to-one mapping between 128-EIA3 inputs and 128-NIA3 inputs.
