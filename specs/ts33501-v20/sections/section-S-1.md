# S.1	Introduction

Non-seamless WLAN offload (NSWO) is an optional capability of a UE supporting WLAN radio access. A UE supporting non-seamless WLAN offload may, while connected to WLAN access, route specific IP flows via the WLAN access without traversing the 3GPP core network.
The present annex specifies the support for authentication for NSWO in 5GS (5G NSWO).
