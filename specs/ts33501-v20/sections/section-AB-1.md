# AB.1	General

This annex specifies the security aspects of PLMN hosting an NPN with dedicated NFs deployed in the PNI_NPN operational domain. The annex describes how to secure the boundary between PLMN operational domain and PNI_NPN operational domain when dedicated NFs interacting with PLMN operational domain through SBA interface and vice versa.
This annex is based on the following assumptions:
-	Mutual trust between PLMN operational domain and the dedicated Network functions at the PNI_NPN operational domain is not in place.
-	Attacks may happen from PNI_NPN operational domain to PLMN operational domain and PLMN operational domain to PNI_NPN operational domain.
