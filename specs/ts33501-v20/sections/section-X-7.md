# X.7	User consent requirements

The user consent requirements for enablers of network automation shall comply with Annex V of the present document and TS 23.288 [105].
For scenarios where local regulations permit, for example vPLMN and hPLMN subject to the same regulatory requirements, the NWDAF shall be deemed to be the enforcement point and shall be subject to the requirement specified in Annex V.
NOTE: 	Depending on the use case and the data source, the enforcement point could be the vNWDAF or the hNWDAF. This is however left to the involved PLMNs to determine.
