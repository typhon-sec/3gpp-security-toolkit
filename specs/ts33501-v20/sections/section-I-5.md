# I.5	SUPI privacy for standalone non-public networks

The UE shall support SUPI privacy as defined in clause 6.12 with the following exception. When using an authentication method other than 5G AKA or EAP-AKA', the location of the functionality related to SUPI privacy in the UE is out of scope.
In scenarios where the EAP-method supports privacy, the UE may send an anonymous SUCI based on configuration.
Furthermore, the privacy considerations for EAP TLS (given in Annex B.2.1.2) should be taken into account when using an authentication method other than 5G AKA or EAP-AKA'.
